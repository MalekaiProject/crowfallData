  description: "One of the most prevalent icons of horror is the scarecrow. Often rudimentary and crude in apperance with an accompanied aura of terror, the scarecrow is often more terrifying in apperance than character, but that doesn't change the fact that they often cause shudders and shivers. Along with the sense of foreboding they can also cause even the most brutal of attackers to be stunned with fright.",
