  description: "The blade takes shape in many forms: swords, daggers, and knives, all of which are quite lethal. Blade Masters often seek prayer with Mave, The Goddess of War, and are quick to force their enemies to pay a toll with their blood. Whether it is a backstab, a sword fight, or the toss of a knife, the blade craves the blood of the enemy as much as the wielder cravers victory",
