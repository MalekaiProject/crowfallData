  "description": "Mischievious, energetic, and jovial in nature, Pixies are known to be an asset to their allies and a pesky nuisance to their enemies.  A bit of the essence of Cybele lives in each Pixie as they offer an ally a quick fix, use their magic dust to assist in healing, and can use their conjury to also alter the size and intimidation of a foe with true ease.",
