Each hit adds one Frost Armor Crack counter (one per second max) and the effect ends if you are hit after your third Frost Armor Crack.\\n\\nWeaving reduces your Ice Stores by one. If your Ice Stores are empty, 250 Mana is drained to create the Ice. If neither cost can be paid, Ice is not woven but Mana is restored instead.",
