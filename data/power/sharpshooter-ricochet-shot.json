    "description": "fires an arrow that can ricochet to strike up to two additional nearby enemies for 77 + 77% Weapon Damage and Roots the target. The arrow will ricochet to a second target within 6m and then ricochet to a third target, has a 100% Critical Strike modifier after the second ricochet but ricochets do not apply a Root. If you hit 3 targets with this power, you gain the Hot Shot buff which applies $buff_amount_1$ $buff_type_1$ for $duration$. Root can only occur once every 24 seconds on a specific target.",
