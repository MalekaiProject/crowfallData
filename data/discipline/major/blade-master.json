    "description": "The blade takes shape in many forms - swords, daggers, and knives - all of which are quite lethal. Blade Masters often seek prayer with Maeve, The Goddess of War, and are quick to force their enemies to pay a toll with their blood. Whether it is a backstab, a sword fight, or the toss of a knife, the blade craves the blood of the enemy as much as the wielder craves victory.",
