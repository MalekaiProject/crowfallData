    "description": "The war hammer is a heavy piece of weaponry meant for close-combat with the intent of piercing through heavy armor.  Similar to a mace, the war hammer requires dexterity and strength to wield, but once a crow masters the war hammer it'll leave many pleading the phrase 'Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em!'.",
