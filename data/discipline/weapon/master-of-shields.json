    "description": "The mighty shield is a versatile form of weaponry that can act as a protector and an antagonizer.  Made of the sturdiest of wood or metals in different sizes and shapes, the shield acts as a protector, a reflector of damage and light, and also deflecting big hits with little cost to stamina.  When paired with another weapon the combination is an unstoppable force on the battlefield.",
