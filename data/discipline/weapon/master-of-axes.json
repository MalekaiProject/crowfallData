    "description": "The battle axe has been a common element in many a skirmish for all ancient cultures; its versatility and ease of use has lead many to embrace it as a primary weapon of cohice.  With the ability to break through armor with a quickness and an opportunity to cleave those who stand in the way, the axe has proven itself as a multifunctional and berserker-style armament.",
